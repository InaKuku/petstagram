Petstagram is a project, built gradually at the workshops of Softuni (Django Module) and refined after the end of the module. 
It allows users to register their pets, upload photos and tag animals (their own or other users` pets). Under the navigaton bar numbers of clicks 
(for the session) are shown. 
PetPhoto details view displays last photos, viewed by the user (after the details of the chosen petphoto).
